"""Re-check every claim this project makes, from scratch, in one command.

The point is to be able to say "it is complete" and mean something checkable
rather than remembered.  Nothing here trusts a previous run: every certificate
on disk is re-verified by the standalone checker, every audit is re-executed,
and every number quoted in the prose is compared against the JSON the
computation actually wrote.

Exit code 0 means every claim in the repository is currently supported by
evidence on disk.  Anything else means a claim has drifted from its evidence and
the write-up is wrong until it is fixed.

Usage:
    python verify_all.py            # everything
    python verify_all.py --fast     # skip the two slow audits
