"""Close the gap the exhaustive audit cannot reach.

encoding_audit.py proves the CNF equals the definition, but only on instances
small enough to enumerate -- n <= 12, j <= 3.  The real instances are n ~ 58
with j = 12, and the one component whose behaviour genuinely depends on the
bound is the at-most-j wildcard constraint (a totalizer, whose structure grows
with the bound).  A bug that only appears at j = 12 would slip through the
small-case audit and would corrupt an UNSAT result in the worst possible way:
too *strong* a cardinality constraint forbids legal colourings, and the solver
then refutes an instance that actually has a witness.

So the constraint is tested at the exact sizes used, from both sides:

  at the limit   any assignment with exactly j wildcards must remain possible
  over the limit any assignment with j+1 wildcards must be rejected

and then the same thing again inside the full formula, by forcing j+1 positions
to be wildcards and requiring the result to be UNSAT.

Usage:  python scale_test.py
