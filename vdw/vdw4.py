"""Mixed van der Waerden numbers -- engine used for the A217058 a(12) attempt.

    w(j+r; 2^j, t_1..t_r) = 1 + max{ n : [1,n] can be split into j "wildcard"
                                     singletons and r colour classes, class i
                                     containing no t_i-term arithmetic progression }

Lower bounds (SAT) are cheap and produce a colouring anybody can check by hand.
The matching upper bound (UNSAT) is where all the time goes, so that is what
this file is built around.  Three changes over vdw2:

1. REVERSAL SYMMETRY BREAKING.  vdw2's `_symbreak` only exchanges colours that
   share a target value, so for targets [3,4] -- the A217058 family -- it emits
   nothing at all and the search runs with no symmetry breaking whatsoever.
   But i -> n+1-i is always an automorphism: it maps t-term APs to t-term APs
   (a, a+d, .., a+(t-1)d  maps to  n+1-a-(t-1)d, .., n+1-a, same d), fixes the
   wildcard count and fixes every colour.  Requiring the colouring to be
   lexicographically <= its own reversal is therefore a sound lex-leader
   constraint that halves the search space.

2. PLUGGABLE ENGINE.  pysat here ships Kissat404 and Cadical300 as well as the
   Cadical195 vdw2 hardcoded; engine_bakeoff.py picks the fastest.
   Non-incremental engines are supported by baking the cube in as unit clauses
   instead of passing assumptions.

3. CRASH-HONEST PARALLELISM.  A worker killed by the OS must never be silently
   read as "this cube is UNSAT" -- that is exactly how a false new term gets
   published.  Every cube must return an explicit verdict or the whole run
   raises.

Soundness is not argued, it is tested: vdw_validate.py replays the published
values of five different target pairs through this engine and every SAT answer
is re-verified by `check`, which reads only the colouring and never the CNF.
