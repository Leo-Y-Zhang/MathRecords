Every number, certificate and timing here is read from the evidence files the
computation actually wrote. Nothing is transcribed by hand, because a submission
is exactly where a hand-copied digit becomes a retraction.

It writes one section per confirmed term, each with the four fields an OEIS edit
needs (DATA, b-file, EXTENSIONS, COMMENT) as literal copy-paste blocks. The
COMMENT is the part that earns acceptance: an editor's real question about an
"unsatisfiable" is why they should believe it, so each comment states what was
audited and, where it applies, what is weaker than it looks.

A term with no agreeing cross-check is EXCLUDED, loudly. That is the whole point
of having run them.
