# OEIS submission pack

Generated from the evidence files, not typed. Every certificate, timing and
DATA line below was read out of the JSON the computation wrote.

**5 term(s) ready to submit.**

## Do this first, every time

Run `python verify_all.py` here. It must exit 0. If it does not, a claim has
drifted from its evidence and nothing should be submitted until it passes.

Registration is already done, so there is no waiting period any more.

## Order to submit

Ranked by evidence actually on disk, strongest first:

* **A217058** a(12)=57 — 3 confirmed refutation path(s), lower bound found by search
* **A217059** a(9)=74 — 3 confirmed refutation path(s), lower bound found by search
* **A217236** a(4)=84 — 3 confirmed refutation path(s), lower bound found by search
* **A217005** a(19)=52 — 3 confirmed refutation path(s), lower bound from the free construction
* **A217007** a(7)=68 — 3 confirmed refutation path(s), lower bound from the free construction

**Submit A217058 first, and alone**, then wait for it to be ACCEPTED before
sending the next. One round-trip teaches more than any amount of preparation,
and a question about your strongest result is better answered once than five
times. The campaign is closed: all five terms were approved between Jul 30 and
Aug 13 2026, and this pack is kept for the record rather than for sending.

## Never

* Submit a term whose cross-check does not say AGREES.
* Retype a certificate. Copy it. A single wrong character is a retraction.
* Claim a term whose family gate did not reproduce the published value.
* Alter or delete a line already in EXTENSIONS. Add yours below the existing ones.
* Write British spellings in a submission: the OEIS uses US English (color,
  relabeling). The comments below are already US-spelled.
* Let a comment grow. The editors asked for brevity and for every technical term
  to be defined before use, since the entry itself never mentions partitions or
  arithmetic progressions. If in doubt, submit DATA and EXTENSIONS with no comment
  at all — an editor explicitly offered that.

## A217058 — a(12) = 57

Page: https://oeis.org/A217058  ·  click **edit**

Cross-check: **AGREES** — the refutation was re-derived through `vdw2`, which has no reversal-symmetry constraint, so it cannot inherit an error from the one piece of new mathematics in the main engine. (Both engines break the standard colour-permutation symmetry, which is textbook and independent of that work.)

### 1. DATA
```
18,21,25,29,33,36,40,42,45,48,52,55,57
```

### 2. b-file — nothing to upload
`A217058` has no uploaded b-file, so the OEIS generates one from DATA and the new term appears there by itself. `b217058.txt` (13 rows, 0 to 12) is in this repository if an editor ever asks for one.

a(12) from _Leo Y. Zhang_, Aug 13 2026
```

### 4. COMMENT — paste verbatim, including the wrapper lines
```
From _Leo Y. Zhang_, Aug 13 2026: (Start)
a(12) = 57 was computed with a SAT solver.

Written out, a(12) is the least n such that every partition of [1,n] into 12+2 classes contains two elements in one of the first 12 classes, a 3-term arithmetic progression in the next, or a 4-term one in the last.

The following partition of [1,56] has none of those, so a(12) > 56. Each "." is one of the 12 classes that must stay a singleton, and 1 and 2 mark the two remaining classes (no 3-term AP in the class marked 1 and no 4-term AP in the class marked 2):

2.21221212.12.22211.112.2221.222.2.1..12221211212..22212

That no such partition of [1,57] exists was confirmed by a second, independent encoding. The partition above was found by search.
(End)
```

*Evidence behind the two sentences above, kept out of the comment because the editors asked for brevity: refutation 6257 s, all 75 cubes; witness 3926 s; free construction alone would give only a(12) >= 56. The family gate reproduced the published a(11) = 55 before this term was claimed (probe_gate_a11_sat.json + probe_gate_a11_unsat.json).*

a(9) = 74 was computed with a SAT solver.
